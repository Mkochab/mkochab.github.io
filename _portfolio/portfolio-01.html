<h2>Cloud generation</h2>
<h3>Procedurally generated clouds</h3>
<p>A common method of cloud generation is introduced in <a href="#references">[1]</a> used in Horizon: Zero Dawn  
    The cloud is procedurally generated using noise.
</p>

<h3>Physically-base generation</h3>
The real-time generation of clouds is based on several theoritical models: atmospheric model, fluid dynamics, and the water transition model of the clouds.
. The implementation is mainly based on <a href="#references">[2]</a> and also adopt a few details from <a href="#references">[3]</a>.
We can generate the clouds based on the input of heat and vapor emission, a set of control parameters, as well as the terrain information.
