<h2>Catrine</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Catrine is a 3D puzzle game involving physics-related puzzle mechanism. 
  A punk cat is trapped in the limbo of cat litters 
due to its bad hygiene habit.
In the game, the cat will find two different catnips which enables it to attract or blow 
away the litter particles for a limited amount of time. The player needs to solve
the puzzle by interacting with the litter particles through the acquired abilities.
The game consists of several levels. In each we depict a chamber with different kinds of puzzles. 
</p>
<p>
The game is made for ETH GameLab course. It is developed with MonoGame framework.
We simulate litter particles on CPU in real time and rendered them with GPU Instancing. 
We integrate Bullet Engine for the rigidbody physics.
The game has a voxelized art style. We made all the textures and models used in the game.</p>

<h2>SandBox</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>We made an interactive digital sandbox application with Microsoft Kinect2 and Unity. With Kinect, we bring in 
  easy gesture controls. The scene can be edited by users in run-time to create a customized environment. 
  Then we can use the sand box as a playground. We introduce different modes, allowing users to either see the whole picture in a bird's eye view,
  or interact with the scene objects.
  </p>
<p>
  We provide two example scenes to demostrate what we can do within the sandbox:<br>
  - The desert scene we present contains a realistic terrain and rich
  attractive environment details. Users can control a steerable airplane to go for a gliding experience.<br>
  - The battlefield scene has a terrain generated from real world height map and texture and various military unit models.
  Users can fly a fighter, or command the movement of a group of the military unit models.

<h2>GodGame</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>We made a strategic card game in Unreal Engine 4. 
  The player is the god of a planet.
